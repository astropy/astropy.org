Roles
-----

The Astropy project is made possible through the efforts of community members that perform numerous important roles. This encompasses a broad scope of responsibilities ranging from direct package development to communication, distribution, and managerial activities. In this section we list the identified project roles and responsible parties, to provide members with a point-of-contact for individual tasks and to give the project an overview of the current state of the team. Different roles on this page have very different scope and effort needed to perform them. Listing on this page is also not mean to be any particular assignment of credit beyond that implict in having the responsibilities of the role. See the `Astropy project role responsibilities <#role-responsibilities>`__ section below for a full description of each role.

We are always looking for interested community members to fill empty roles and to join existing teams. Community members may volunteer or nominate someone else for any role by emailing coordinators@astropy.org or by getting in touch with the current team.
