The astropy core package is a community-driven Python package intended
to contain much of the core functionality and common tools needed for
astronomy and astrophysics. It is part of the Astropy Project, which
aims to foster an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages for
Python.

New and improved major functionality in this release includes:

- Quantity data types
- Updates to astropy.cosmology
- Topocentric ITRS Frame
- Enhanced Fixed Width ASCII Tables
- Accessing cloud-hosted FITS files
- Drawing the instrument beam and a physical scale bar on celestial
  images
- Interior ticks and tick labels
- Support for tilde-prefixed paths
- CCDData PSF Image representation

In addition, hundreds of smaller improvements and fixes have been made.
An overview of the changes is provided at:
