The astropy core package is a community-driven Python package intended
to contain much of the core functionality and common tools needed for
astronomy and astrophysics. It is part of the Astropy Project, which
aims to foster an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages for
Python.

Notable changes in this release include:

- A faster ECSV table reader
- Generic DataFrame conversion methods
- Table index improvements and deprecation
- Cosmology traits
- An option to preserve units in FITS-WCS
- Concatenation and stacking of coordinates and time classes

In addition, hundreds of smaller improvements and fixes have been made.
An overview of the changes is provided at:

     https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/whatsnew/7.2.html
