Astropy v0.4 Released!
======================

Dear colleagues,

We are very happy to announce the third major public release (v0.4) of
the astropy package, a core Python package for Astronomy:

http://www.astropy.org

Astropy is a community-driven package intended to contain much of the
core functionality and common tools needed for performing astronomy and
astrophysics with Python.

New and improved major functionality in this release includes:

- A new astropy.vo.samp sub-package adapted from the previously
  standalone SAMPy package
- A re-designed astropy.coordinates sub-package for celestial
  coordinates
- A new ‘fitsheader’ command-line tool that can be used to quickly
  inspect FITS headers
- A new HTML table reader/writer
- Improved performance for Quantity objects
- A re-designed configuration framework

In addition, hundreds of smaller improvements and fixes have been made.
An overview of the changes is provided at:

     https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/whatsnew/0.4.html

Instructions for installing Astropy are provided on our
`website <http://www.astropy.org>`__, and extensive documentation can be

In particular, if you use Anaconda, you can update to v0.4 with:
