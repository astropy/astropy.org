The astropy core package is a community-driven Python package intended
to contain much of the core functionality and common tools needed for
astronomy and astrophysics. It is part of the Astropy Project, which
aims to foster an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages for
Python.

New and improved major functionality in this release includes:

- Define Geodetic and Bodycentric Representations via their geometric
  parameters
- Body-fixed planetary reference frames and their WCS description
- Support for Numpy broadcasting over frame data and attributes
- Updates to cosmology
- Updates to how IERS data are handled
- Masked Time values now use Masked arrays internally
- Reading and writing VO model annotations
- TimeDelta string format “quantity_str”
- VOTable now supports PARQUET serialization
- Faster FITS file decompression
- New GeneralSersic2D model

In addition, hundreds of smaller improvements and fixes have been made.
An overview of the changes is provided at:
