The astropy core package is a community-driven Python package intended
to contain much of the core functionality and common tools needed for
astronomy and astrophysics. It is part of the Astropy Project, which
aims to foster an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages for
Python.

New and improved major functionality in this release includes:

- New flat astropy.cosmology classes
- New union operators for Table
- Efficient data access for compressed FITS files
- Added support for NOCOMPRESS for compressed FITS files
- New fraction option for representing units as strings
- Change in order in unit string representations
- Support for collapse operations on arbitrary axes in nddata
- Refresh cached observatory site registry for EarthLocation methods
- New LombScargleMultiband class for multiband datasets

In addition, hundreds of smaller improvements and fixes have been made.
An overview of the changes is provided at:
