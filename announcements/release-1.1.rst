Dear colleagues,

We are very happy to announce the v1.1 release of the Astropy package, a
core Python package for Astronomy:

Astropy is a community-driven Python package intended to contain much of
the core functionality and common tools needed for astronomy and
astrophysics.

New and improved major functionality in this release includes:

- New functions to automatically determine histogram bins, including the
  Bayesian blocks algorithm
- A new interface to transform between Table objects and pandas
  DataFrame objects
- Support for table indexing
- Support for supergalactic and ecliptic coordinates
- A new .info attribute to get summary information about tables and
  columns
- A new show_in_notebook() method to show a table in Jupyter/IPython
  notebooks with additional interactivity features
- Support for new units, including logarithmic units such as magnitudes,
  dex, and decibels
- Support for the Planck 2015 cosmology and significant performance
  improvements in the cosmology sub-package

In addition, hundreds of smaller improvements and fixes have been made.
An overview of the changes is provided at:

     https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/whatsnew/1.1.html

Instructions for installing Astropy are provided on our
`website <http://www.astropy.org>`__, and extensive documentation can be
found at:

     https://docs.astropy.org

If you make use of the `Anaconda Python
Distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__, you can update to
Astropy v1.1 with:

::

       conda update astropy

Whereas if you usually use pip, you can do:

::

       pip install astropy --upgrade

Please report any issues, or request new features via our GitHub
repository:

     https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues

Over 160 developers have contributed code to Astropy so far, and you can
find out more about the team behind Astropy here:

     http://www.astropy.org/team.html

As a reminder, Astropy v1.0 (our long term support release) will
continue to be supported with bug fixes until Feb 19th 2017, so if you
need to use Astropy in a very stable environment, you may want to
consider staying on the v1.0.x set of releases rather than upgrading to
v1.1.

If you use Astropy directly for your work, or as a dependency to another
package, please remember to include the following acknowledgment at the
end of papers:

package for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration, 2013).

We hope that you enjoy using Astropy as much as we enjoyed developing
it!
