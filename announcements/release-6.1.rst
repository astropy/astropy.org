The astropy core package is a community-driven Python package intended
to contain much of the core functionality and common tools needed for
astronomy and astrophysics. It is part of the Astropy Project, which
aims to foster an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages for
Python.

Notable changes in this release include:

- Warnings are now emitted when carrying out order-dependent angular
  separation calculations
- Cosmology classes are now Python dataclasses
- Compatibility with the upcoming major Numpy 2.0 release
- Changes to the meaning of the copy= argument when using Numpy 2.0
- io.ascii now uses 64-bit integers by default for integer numerical
  data on all platforms
- Minimum supported version of Python updated to 3.10

In addition, hundreds of smaller improvements and fixes have been made.
An overview of the changes is provided at:

     https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/whatsnew/6.1.html
