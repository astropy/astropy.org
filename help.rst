Getting Help with Astropy
=========================

The best way to get help is usually by asking questions to the
Astropy user and development community. There are a number of
active forums and you are welcome to use whichever one you are the
most comfortable with.

- `Open Astronomy
  Discourse <https://community.openastronomy.org/c/astropy/8>`__ -
  This forum allows questions to be tagged by topic, is searchable
  on Google, and displays code snippets well. Please head over and
  ask (and answer) questions.
- `Astropy Slack workspace <https://astropy.slack.com>`__ (`get an
  account <http://joinslack.astropy.org>`__) - This forum is
  primarily focused on developing and maintaining the Astropy
  project, but the ``#community-help`` channel is a good place for
  users to seek help from the Astropy community.
- `Astropy Users Email List
  [astropy@python.org] <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/astropy>`__
  - Post questions or start discussions about anything related to
  Python programming applied to astronomy.
- `Astropy Developers Email List
  [astropy-dev@googlegroups.com] <http://groups.google.com/group/astropy-dev>`__
  - Start discussions and ask questions about changing or adding
  functionality to the ``astropy`` package. This is also the place
  where significant announcements for contributors/developers are
  usually made. If you would like to participate in discussion
  about how the Project is run, please join this list.
