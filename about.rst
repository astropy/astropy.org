About The Astropy Project
=========================

The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a core
package for astronomy using the `Python programming
language <http://www.python.org>`__ and improve usability,
interoperability, and collaboration between astronomy Python
packages. The core *astropy* package contains functionality aimed
at professional astronomers and astrophysicists, but may be useful
to anyone developing astronomy software. The Astropy Project also
includes "affiliated packages," Python packages that are not
necessarily developed by the core development team, but share the
goals of Astropy, and often build from the core package's code and
infrastructure.

Aside from the actual code, Astropy is also a community of
astronomy- associated users and developers that agree that sharing
utilities is healthy for the community and the science it
produces. This community is of course central to accomplishing
anything with the code itself. We welcome anyone who wishes to
contribute to the project and expect everyone in our community to
follow the `code of conduct <code_of_conduct.html>`__ when
interacting with others.

For more details on background of the project, you can read the
`original
vision <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/vision.html>`__
from when the project was founded.


``astropy`` Core Package
------------------------

The *astropy* package (alternatively known as the "core" package)
contains various classes, utilities, and a packaging framework
intended to provide commonly-used astronomy tools. It is divided
into a variety of sub-packages, which are described in detail in
the `documentation <https://docs.astropy.org/>`__.

Affiliated Packages
-------------------

The Astropy project includes the concept of "affiliated packages."
An affiliated package is an astronomy-related python package that
is not part of the *astropy* core source code, but has requested
to be included in the general community effort of the Astropy
project. Such a package may be a candidate for eventual inclusion
in the main *astropy* package (although this is not required).
Until then, however, it is a separate package, and may not be in
the *astropy* namespace.

The authoritative listing of current affiliated packages is
available at http://affiliated.astropy.org. That page also
describes the process to get a package listed as an affiliated
package.
