Astropy Community Code of Conduct
=================================

Since November 2025, the Astropy Project has adopted the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct, which is summarized below. For the previous version of the Astropy Code of Conduct, click :ref:`here <astropy-org-coc-old>`.


The Short Version
-----------------

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others.
Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Astropy.

Astropy is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

The Long Version
----------------

You can find the long version of the Code of Conduct on the `NumFOCUS website <https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct>`__.

How To Report
-------------

If you feel that the Code of Conduct has been violated, you can submit a report via the `NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Reporting Form <https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT?typeform-source=numfocus.org>`__.

Who Will Receive Your Report
----------------------------

Your report will be received and handled by NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Working Group; trained, and experienced contributors with diverse backgrounds.
The group is making decisions independently from the project, PyData, NumFOCUS, or any other organization.

The Working Group will work with the Astropy Project's Ombudsperson to resolve an incident: The NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Working group will review the incident, and provide recommendations on how to handle this or what consequences or sanction might be appropriate.
As per `Astropy's governance charter <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst>`__, the Astropy Ombudsperson along with the Coordination Committee will receive those recommendations and perform any actions necessary to address the concern.

Examples
--------

To make this Code of Conduct more concrete, we provide here some hypothetical examples of how a Code of Conduct issue might arise that may be particular to our community:

- A member of the Astropy community might express a preference on
  an online forum for a specific tool or programming language
  (e.g., Python) over another language. If this preference is
  expressed as a personal preference or with reference to
  particular technical merits of that language vs. others, there
  is no violation of the Code of Conduct. However, if that member
  instead expresses this preference by way of insult to those who
  use another language, or via violent imagery directed at those
  other languages or its users, that would be an act of "tool
  shaming" and be a violation of the Code of Conduct.
- If a member of the community knowingly uses a software tool or
  astronomical dataset in a public package or academic publication
  without acknowledging or citing the tool in a reasonable way
  requested by the upstream tool, this is a violation of the Code
  of Conduct. If the member makes a reasonable effort to find an
  acknowledgement and one is not available, this would not be a
  Code of Conduct violation (although it might or might not
  represent a violation of copyright law depending on the details
  of the situation and adopted license).
- If an Astropy maintainer were to post a message in a public
  forum that is insulting an astronomy research community member's
  skills as a programmer, this would be a violation of the Code of
  Conduct, as the researcher is also a member of our community.
  Conversely, if a researcher insultingly rejected a maintainer's
  suggestion because the maintainer is not a scientist, this would
  be a violation by the researcher. If that same thing were stated
  in a meeting with other Astropy maintainers, it may or may not
  represent a code of conduct violation, depending on whether the
  intent is to insult vs. pointing out a skill lack in the
  community in a productive manner.
