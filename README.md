This repository contains the Astropy web site (primary URL https://astropy.org).

> [!NOTE]
> In a previous version of this web site (on the [old_site branch](https://github.com/astropy/astropy.org/tree/old_site)), this repository held the build for the site, but the content was generated from the [astropy-website repository](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-website).  That repo is no longer active, and issues with the Astropy web site should now be reported in *this* repository.
